WHAT IS IT?
===========

OpenSCAD (Open Solid CAD) is a tool for designing solid 3D objects using CSG
techniques. Basically OpenSCAD is a compiler that transforms descriptions of
3D objects written in a special computer language to 3D models.

FIXME: Add some more introduction..


Building on Ubuntu 17.10 64 bits
=============

sudo apt-get build-dep libcgal-dev
sudo apt install unrar
sudo apt install subversion
sudo apt install flex
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
sudo apt install qtscript5-dev
sudo apt install libglew-dev
sudo apt install libopencsg-dev

You will have a very old openscad, but much more tweakable!
